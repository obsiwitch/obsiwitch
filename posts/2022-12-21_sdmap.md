# Steam Deck controller remapping

The Steam Deck controller can be remapped through Steam, but I wanted a solution that didn't require Steam to be launched all the time and would allow me to switch between a regular gamepad layout and a desktop layout.

First I had to add support for the controller in my kernel by applying the patches present in the SteamOS kernel. I packaged the patched files as a [DKMS module](https://github.com/obsiwitch/dotfiles/tree/main/packages/hid-steam-deck-dkms) that didn't require me to recompile my whole kernel.

Then I wrote a [tool](https://github.com/obsiwitch/dotfiles/tree/main/packages/sdmap) to remap the controller events.
